# Using the App

When you open the app there will be three main control buttons:

From top to bottom:
1: Reshuffle the deck: Re-adds visited planes to the deck to allow re-visitng planes.
2: Planeswalk: Change the plane to the next one and put the current one in the discard pile
3: Roll: Roll the planar die, if a Planeswalker symbol appears, change the plane, if the Chaos symbol appears, follow the card's instructions.

When the last card in the deck is planeswalked away from, a red X will appear. Pressing planeswalk again will reset the deck and start over!
